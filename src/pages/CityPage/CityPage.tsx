          <h2 id="objective">City Craze Mode</h2>
          <p>
            The objective of City Craze is to score the most points by building great
            cities within the limits of a board. üí°
          </p>
          <p>
            The game is played by placing tiles on the board to create a landscape. The
            landscape will be occupied by tiles representing abbeys and cities. Each of
            these tiles give the player a different amount of points.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>At the start of each game, you will be dealt four random tiles.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>On each turn you will only be able to place one tile of these types:</p>
              <ul>

                  <p>
                    üè∞ Cities: They can be placed in any free space that is adjacent to
                    any placed tile, as long as the tile edges match their surroundings.

                    ‚õ™ Abbeys: They can be placed in any free space that is adjacent to
                    any city, as long as the tile edges match their surroundings. It can
                    not be placed next to another abbey

            <li>
              <p>
                You are able to discard the tiles in your hand, but this ability takes 5
                turns to recharge.

            <li>
              <p>
                The game ends when all tiles have been placed, or a tile in your current
                hand can&apos;t be played and you have no discards available. üí•

          <h2 id="points">Points ‚≠ê</h2>
          <p>You are able to gain points through a variety of ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Abbeys give you {1 * pointsMultiplier} {pointPlural} for each tile that
                surrounds it. This way, the maximum amount of points per Abbey is{' '}
                {1 * pointsMultiplier} {pointPlural}
                points.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Cities only give you points if they are closed, meaning a wall is
                surrounding every tile that composes the city. The size of the completed
                city defines how many points you get:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      2 - 4 tiles: You gain {1 * pointsMultiplier} {pointPlural} for each
                      tile.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      5 - 9 tiles: You gain {2 * pointsMultiplier} {pointPlural} for each
                      tile.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      10 - 14 tiles: You gain {3 * pointsMultiplier} {pointPlural} for
                      each tile.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      15+ tiles: You gain {4 * pointsMultiplier} {pointPlural} for each
                      tile.
                    </p>
