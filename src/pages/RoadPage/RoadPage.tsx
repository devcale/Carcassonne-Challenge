          <h2 id="objective">Road Rally Mode</h2>
          <p>
            The objective of Road Rally is to score the most points by strategically
            placing tiles within the limits of a board. Be careful, as roads now can only
            be placed if they match their surrounding roadsüí°
          </p>
          <p>
            The game is played by placing tiles on the board to create a landscape. The
            landscape will be occupied by tiles representing roads, abbeys and cities.
            Each of these tiles give the player a different amount of points.
          </p>

              <p>At the start of each game, you will be dealt four random tiles.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>On each turn you will only be able to place one tile of these types:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    üè∞ Cities: They can be placed in any free space that is adjacent to
                    any placed tile.

                </li>

                  <p>
                    üõ£Ô∏è Roads: They can be placed in any free space that has an adjacent
                    road, as long as it matches the adjacent roads.

                    ‚õ™ Abbeys: They can be placed in any free space that is adjacent to
                    any placed tile.

                </li>

            <li>
              <p>After a tile is placed, you will be dealt a new random tile.</p>

            <li>
              <p>
                You are able to discard the tiles in your hand, but this ability takes 5
                turns to recharge.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The game ends when all tiles have been placed, or a tile in your current
                hand can&apos;t be played and you have no discards available. üí•

          <h2 id="points">Points ‚≠ê</h2>
          <p>You are able to gain points through a variety of ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Roads give you one point per tile.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Abbeys give you one point for each tile that surrounds it. This way, the
                maximum amount of points per Abbey is 8 points.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Cities gives you two points per tile, and an extra point for each city
                chain.
